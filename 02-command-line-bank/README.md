# 02: Command-Line Bank

A simple, text-based banking application that allows a user to manage a checking account. This project was built to practice structuring a complete application with multiple interacting parts.

### Features:

-   Check account balance.
-   Deposit funds with input validation (no negative amounts).
-   Withdraw funds with input validation and insufficient funds check.
-   A persistent main menu loop for continuous operation.

### Key Concepts Practiced:

-   **Application Structure:** Organizing code with a `main()` function and helper functions.
-   **State Management:** Passing a variable (the balance) between functions.
-   **Loops for Menus:** Using `while True` to create a persistent menu system.
-   **Complex Conditional Logic:** Handling multiple conditions for deposits and withdrawals.
-   **User Input Validation:** Ensuring the user provides valid numerical input.
